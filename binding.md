<h1>Binding the quilt</h1>

<h2>Making the binding</h2>

Some places sell pre-made binding, but why buy that when we can make our own out of any cotton fabric?

I cut the fabric into 2" strips and then joined them at a 45° angle. Iron the seam open, and we have an extremely long piece of 2" fabric!

Next I ironed that in half, right side facing out. At one end I folded the fabric over, like so:

You'll see why in the next step.

<h2>Attaching the binding</h2>

I attached the binding to one side of the quilt starting with the folded over end. We actually want to *unfold* the binding (but not the little triangle) and sew it down like that, then refold the binding and continue sewing.

At the corner, my technique for making a mitered corner is:

1. Stop before getting to the edge and fold the binding over at a 45°.
2. Stitch the binding down until we get to that fold line.
3. Re-fold it on the crease we just made.
4. Fold it back over.
5. Rotate the entire quilt 90° and continue sewing the binding down along the next edge.

Eventually we get back to where we started. My techniquere here is to trim the binding, tuck it in under the starting fold, and then finish sewing it down. Voilà, the binding is fully attached on one side!

Normally the next step would be to iron this seam, then fold it over and iron again from the other side. However, this fleece is made of polyester so it will melt if I iron it so I finger pressed it as I sewed instead.

It turned out quite well -- this is honestly the best job of binding a quilt I've ever done. Just look at how neat this corner is!

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

And with that, the quilt is complete!

It took me ~25 minutes to make the binding and a little over an hour to bind the quilt, so let's call that 1.5h total.

**Grand total time:** 45mins + 3h + 3h + 1h45mins + 2h45mins + 1.5h + 1h45mins + 1.5h + 1.5h = 17.5 hours.
