<h1>Binding the quilt</h1>

<h2>Making the binding</h2>

Some places sell pre-made binding, but why buy that when we can make our own out of any cotton fabric.

I cut the fabric into 2" strips, and then joined them at a 45Â° angle. Iron the seam open, and we have an extremely long piece of 2" fabric!

Next I ironed that in half, right side facing out. At one end I folded the fabric over, like so:

You'll see why in the next step.
