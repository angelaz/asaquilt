<h1>Quilting</h1>

Did you know that the entire process so far has not yet been quilting? All of the aforementioned steps have been constructing the top. *Now* it's time to quilt.

I started by setting up a quilt sandwich -- backing fabric (in our case, forest green anti-pill polar fleece), lofting, and then the top.

Have you ever eaten a sandwich and by the time you got to the other end the fillings were falling out despite it being aligned to start with? This is a result of the unevenly applied pressure of you taking bites. The same thing will happen when quilting, so people typically recommend quilting from the inside out, alternating directions you're sewing in, etc.

I deal with this by using a bajillion pins. The fabric can't move too much if it's pinned every couple of inches.

I do not have a long arm machine, so I roll up the sides of the quilt and quilt with a walking foot on my regular sewing machine.

I've found that using hair clips to help manage the bulk is pretty useful, so here's a picture of that --

Many, many long and wiggly lines later we have a quilted quilt! I trimmed it down to size, and here's the final result:

**Total time:** 1h30.

Lastly, we'll need to [bind the quilt](binding.md).
