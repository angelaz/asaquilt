<h1>Appliqué Totoro</h1>

As I [mentioned before](/sketching.md#layout-changes), I wanted to make an appliqué sleeping Totoro to go on shelf #2.

First things first, gotta iron and cut out a piece of background fabric.

Then I cut out the sleeping Totoro:

Flipped it over and traced it on the woven interfacing:

Ironed the interfacing onto a grey t-shirt I was using:

And cut that out:

Next I sketched the details on as a guideline for myself to embroider later:

After that it was time for something that felt very sacrilegious: Deconstructing the Totoro and trimming out its tummy. I opted to go ahead and use the interfacing as the white fabric here.

I ironed that on and sketched out its arm, and we have a basic Totoro!

Now, since I want to appliqué the Totoro onto the quilt I need to make it iron-on-able. (That's totally a word.) Enter, heat-n-bond! I cut an appropriately-sized piece:

But then realized that if I ironed this as-is it would melt onto my ironing board or iron around the edges. I probably should've attached this earlier, before trimming the Totoro out, but instead I ironed it with a piece of scrap fabric to keep it from melding with my ironing board.

Here's what it looks like with the paper peeled off:

I trimmed that down to size and we have an ironable Totoro! Next up it's time to make the little crescent-like things that on Totoro's stomach. I applied heat-n-bond to a bit of leftover fabric from making the initial Totoro and sketched them on:
![Little crescents](/images/crescents.jpg)

I trimmed them out (which was *very* finicky due to their tiny size), positioned and ironed them on, and ironed the Totoro onto the background fabric.

Now, I still don't trust iron-on things (even though truth be told heat-n-bond holds *really* well) so I also sewed each piece into place. Here are front and back views:

To finish off the details of the Totoro, I hand-stitched with DMC 310 for the black bits and DMC 613 for the claws at the hands & feet.

Here's the completed block! I went ahead and reused [the books I had to remove from shelf #3](/shelf4.md#attaching-shelves-3--4) here as the books to the right of Totoro.

**Total time:** 1h45. Continue reading [here](/shelves1and2.md).
