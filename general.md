<h1>General preparation</h1>

For the bookshelf itself I'm going to use 2" strips (~1.5" after sewing) for the "wood" and 5" strips for the border around the shelf. To start with I went ahead and cut out some long strips.

All of the fabrics I'll be using are jersey knit, which means they stretch and can become distorted while sewing.

The way to deal with this is to use [woven interfacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfacing) ironed on to the back side of the fabric.
