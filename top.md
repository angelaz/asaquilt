<h1>Finishing the top</h1>

Not a whole lot to say here, just a ton of straight seams.

First, I attached the top two and bottom two bookshelves to each other with one more row of brown in between.

Then I added brown fabric and the border fabric to both the left and right sides.

During this part of the process, I had to make an incredibly tragic cut while trimming. :( Poor guy...

Finally, I added the background fabric to the top as well and we're done!

**Total time:** 1h45.
