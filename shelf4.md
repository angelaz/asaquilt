<h1>Shelf #4</h1>

The process here was very similar to that of the previous shelf, except that I started with some horizontal books instead.

Asa's mom ordered a couple of iron-on embroidered patches for me to incorporate into the quilt. I, however, do not trust iron-on things to actually stay so I matched my thread to the border as well as I could and reinforced it with stitching. 

Here's a front and back view:

<h2>Ordering the books</h2>

I wanted to share a bit more about what my process for deciding what order to put the books in looks like. Basically, I follow the [same aesthetic rules as last time](/shelf3.md#ordering-the-books) but with the addendum of:

1. Do not re-use the same fabric too close to itself. Concretely: If I previously used a book on the far left, it's acceptable to now use it somewhere on the right.

I basically just lay out fabrics and rearrange until it looks nice to me.

<h2>Cutting and ironing</h2>

Since I didn't include any pictures of this last time, here's what it looks like to iron woven interfacing onto the back of a fabric:

Then cut the fabric, ad repeat until done. Same process as [last time](/shelf3.md#cutting-out-the-books-1), except I didn't bother pining this time.

<h2>Sewing shelf #4</h2>

Here's each book sewn to the top bit:

And ironed:

Then it's time to start sewing the books to each other. Here's a couple of them sewn:

All of them sewn and ironed:

And repeat until done! Here are front and back views of the completed shelf:

<h2>Adding the brown</h2>

To start with, I pinned a long strip of the brown fabric (for the bookshelf itself) onto the bottom of shelf #3.

Then I machine sewed that, and trimmed the excess.

Unfortunately, I learned the hard way† that the brown fabric has a tendency to fray so I wanted to reinforce this seam. After ironing I topstitched along the seam with matching dark brown thread.

Same process for shelf #4, but I also went ahead and added the fabric for the space underneath the shelf now. Same deal with topstitching, except that I used white thread. Here's a closeup of both rows of topstitching:

†Long story short: After machine washing my son's quilt, there were holes in several places along the seams between the brown fabric and other fabrics. I do not believe in hand wash only baby items (I mean, I acknowledge they exist but do not think they *should* exist) so I wound up unpicking his entire quilt, re-doing it with topstitching along the brown, and putting the whole thing back together. I have since machine washed that quilt with no further issues.

<h2>Attaching shelves 3 & 4</h2>

When it came time to attach the 2 shelves to each other, I ran into a problem: Shelf #3 was considerably wider than shelf #4. I measured, and shelf #4 was about 23" across whereas shelf #3 was 25" across. 

This is a result of my cutting vs. sewing margins and the fact that shelf #3 has more books. Basically, I tend to cut the fabrics with an eyeballed margin of about a centimeter all around but sew with a 3/8" margin. The tiny difference between those two measurements at every vertical seam adds up, so here we are.

Visually I want the slanted books to be centered, so I unpicked the leftmost 2 books on shelf #3 (I'll reuse those books later!), trimmed the brown down to the new width, and then attched the shelves to each other. (Again, with topstiching to reinforce the seam.)

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Here's a front and back view of the bookshelf so far:

**Total time:** 3 hours.
