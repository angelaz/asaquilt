<h1>Shelves #1 & #2</h1>

<h2>Finishing shelf #2</h2>
Completing shelf #2 followed the same process as before. Here are front and back views:

<h2>Making shelf #1</h2>

I started by making an appliqué plant pot. Same process as for the Totoro, but much simpler -- iron on heat-n-bond, trace out the pot, cut it out, iron onto the background fabric.

Here's the plant pot, as seen from the front and the back. I kept it pretty simple because this will mostly be covered by appliqué leaves later anyways.

Otherwise making this inner shelf was the same as the other 3 times.

<h2>Attaching the shelves</h2>

Not much to say here, just long horizontal seams. I constructed both shelves right-to-left so I could check the width as I went along and not accidentally make a shelf that was way too wide again.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It took me an hour to finish shelf #2, 1h15 minutes to make shelf #1, and another ~30 minutes to attach them.

**Total time:** 2h45.
