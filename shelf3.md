<h1>Shelf #3</h1>

<h2>Cutting out the books</h2>

To start with, we have the very rote task of cutting out every book. I decided to begin with what will be bookshelf #3 because it has the most books, so let's get that over with.

I highly recommend labeling both the top and bottom portions of each vertical strip with a number to keep track of what's what.

<h2>Cutting out the interfacing and background color</h2>

Here I had an insight that I'm quite proud of: When I was making the quilt for my son, I found it incredibly annoying and finicky to have to cut out tons and tons of rectangles of woven interfacing and the background fabric. This time I decided to sort the books by width, and cut out long strips of both fabrics that I could then cut down to size as I go!

Now I only need to cut off rectangles of the appropriate length as I go -- hooray for preprocessing!

<h2>Ordering the books</h2>

Deciding what order to put the fabrics in is incredibly subjective, so I'll just share my aesthetic guidelines here:
- Avoid having the same pattern next to itself (i.e. no stripes next to stripes)
- Vary lights and darks when possible
- Minimize putting colors that are too close in shade next to each other (a bunch of blues all in a row might look too homogenous and blobby)
- Avoid putting fabrics with directionality in the wrong direction, i.e. no upside-down faces
- Mostly follow the grain line, but break this rule when it'll be cuter since I'm using woven interfacing as backing anyway
- Highlight cute bits of the fabrics

<h2>Cutting out the books</h2>

My process for this was:
1. Cut the vertical strips apart at the horizontal delineator for the book vs. background color
2. Cut rectangles of interfacing and background color
3. Iron woven interfacing onto the wrong side of the relevant book fabric
4. Cut that^ out
5. Pin together the background fabric and book fabric so I don't misplace them

<h2>Sewing the books together</h2>

To start with, I sewed each book to the background color (basically sewing where the pins are) and ironed the seams flat. I also labeled each shelf with its number during this step to help me keep track -- pencil works quite well on interfacing, and no one's ever going to see the back! (Just don't use something that'll bleed through to the front like a sharpie or something.)

Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures of the process for the slanted books, so I'll attempt to illustrate how I did those instead.

We're going to use post-its to demonstrate so you can see things better in 3D. The dashed pencil lines represent where we'll be sewing (i.e. the margin), and the pink horizontal line at the bottom of the post-it represents our line drawn in tailor's chalk.

This chalk line represents *where the inner shelf will meet the bookshelf*, so note that we want to intersect it on the left side with where the bottom of the book and the sewing margin meet, *not* where the bottom of the book and the background fabric meet! This is important if you don't want the book to look like it's floating.

Next, we'll fold the next book over to represent the sewing margin and line that up with where the chalk and the margin meet on the right side of the book. Pin in place along the margin, and sew!

I'd would suggest basting at first so you can unfold it and check that it lines up well before committing to sewing the seam down properly. Repeat for the next book, and then sew big triangles on the bottom left and top right of the slanted shelf.

Joining the books to each other is a matter of sewing straight seams, ironing, and repeat.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Here's the completed shelf, both front and back views ft. my cat.

**Total time:** 3 hours. It took me 45 minutes to cut things out and another 2h15 to sew & iron.
