<h1>Appliqu√© Leaves</h1>

When I made the quilt for my son, I bought a fabric that had leaves I could repurpose.

I cut out little bits of heat-n-bond and ironed them on to the leaves I wanted to use all over the fabric.

Next came trimming these out -- that took a while, but then I had a little pile of leaves to use.

After that I peeled the backing off of the heat-n-bond and spent a while draping the leaves until I had an arrangement I was satisfied with. This time I did my arranging directly on my ironing board so I could iron them down immediately. (Last time, I did the arranging elsewhere and had to carefully move the final product over *and* I had left the backing on the heat-n-bond so I couldn't iron it down until I picked up each leaf, peeled it, and put it back approximately where it was.)

Lastly, I stitched around every leaf with a zig-zag stitch to prevent fraying and prevent the leaves from ever coming off. (If Asa is anything like my son this is quite necessary, as the first thing my kid did when I gave him his quilt was try to peel off various bits of it...) 

I very nearly ran out of dark green thread, but we just barely made it!

Here are front and back views of the finished leaves:

**Total time:** 1.5 hours.
