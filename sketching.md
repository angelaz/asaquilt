<h1>Sketching the blocks</h1>

A couple of months ago, I made a lovely bookshelf quilt out of clothes my son had outgrown and scraps that I retroactively feel quite justified in hoarding. I shared the quilt with my Discord moms' group, and another mom expressed interest in commissioning a similar quilt for her son Asa.

I decided to offer to do it, partly because I wanted to document the process for anyone else who may want to embark on a similar project in the future.

<h2>Planning</h2>

Asa's mom wanted a very similar quilt to the one I made for my son, so I opted to use the same dimensions as I did for the previous quilt I made.

I intended on a 32" x 50" quilt, but in practice the quilt came out slightly larger since I rounded up at every margin. I also originally planned on having 3 shelves, but after sketching/cutting out example shelves using tracing paper I thought the shelves had too much whitespace so I changed it to 4 shelves.

<h2>Sketching</h2>

Using these same dimensions, each inner bookshelf would be 8.75" x 21". (See? I'm already rounding up because I am *not* about to try to measure out 8.63".) To start with I cut some tracing paper to these dimensions.

Aesthetic principles:
- Vary the heights
- Vary the widths
- Avoid having too many extremely tiny (>1/2") books, as these are extremely annoying to sew

Asa is very into Totoro, so Asa's mom bought some embroidered patches to incorporate into the quilt.

Tools:
- Tracing paper
- Pencil
- Eraser
- Straight ruler
- Quilting ruler (these are square rulers that are *very* helpful for drawing 90° angles!)

<h2>Layout changes</h2>

On my son's quilt the topmost shelf had a flower pot with a flower, but given Asa's love for Totoro I thought it would be fun to try to make an appliqué sleeping Totoro instead. After I sketched out the Totoro I felt like there was too much blank space above it, so it'd be cool to have the plant pot with trailing leaves descend into this space.

With that in mind the Totoro is a bit far too the left to make that line up well, so when I make this shelf I'm going to move the leftmost book in the right grouping over to the other side of the Totoro instead.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I'm excited to work on this project, and very pleased about the idea of adding a large sleeping Totoro. I'll also be incorporating a bit of hand-embroidery for details (eyes, nose, whiskers, claws), which will be fun since I haven't done that on a quilt before!
